Laravel AMI
===========

An AMI for Laravel projects based on Homestead provisioning scripts. __Do not use in production__; this AMI was created for use with the [Vagrant AWS](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) provider for running tests in a CI environment, and is likely unsecure.

Usage
-----

Note that AWS is the only supported provider, and as such the box cannot be used with other providers such as VirtualBox.
